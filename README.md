# IND Appointment helper

Telegram bot that helps with tracking open slots at IND in the Netherlands.

## Interactions with the bot

 To start tracking a particular location execute command from chat:

```
/track
```

You will be prompted to select one of the available appointment types. Depending on the type you will be presented with
the set of available locations that provide such appointments.
Then you can select number of people - 1 to 6.
Optionally, if you are only interested in time windows before particular date you can specify it in YYYY-MM-DD
format, otherwise you can specify tracking all time slots.

After that you will receive notifications about open windows with a mention of the first available window and number of
other possible options. Notifications do not start after the first one and might repeat the same information.

To stop tracking execute the command:

```
/stoptrack
```
